# Deploying patchy

Operator documentation for the Kubernetes deployment: what runs where, the GitHub App you must register, the Secrets and
custom resources you must create, and an honest account of what the agent sandbox does and does not guarantee.

For _what the system does_, read [DESIGN.md](../DESIGN.md); for _where the code lives_, read [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).

Prefer Helm? [`charts/patchy`](../charts/patchy/README.md) renders this same stack (published to
`oci://ghcr.io/bitwise-media-group/patchy/charts/patchy` on release; the Integration/Forge CRs install separately via
[`charts/patchy-config`](../charts/patchy-config/README.md)); everything below about the App, the Secrets, and the
sandbox applies to both.

The Dockerfiles live at the repo root: `Dockerfile.controller` (all controllers, ARG `TARGET`) and one per-harness agent
image — `Dockerfile.claude-agent-runner` (agent-runner + git + claude CLI) and `Dockerfile.codex-agent-runner`
(agent-runner + git + codex CLI). A Job runs the image of the harness resolved for its model.

## What gets deployed where

Two namespaces, and the split between them is the security boundary.

| Namespace       | Workload                                                                                                                                                      | Credentials it holds                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `patchy`        | `integration-controller` (the only internet-facing workload), `source-controller`, `context-controller`, `investigation-controller`, `remediation-controller` | reads the GitHub Secret referenced by your Integration/Forge CRs |
| `patchy-agents` | ephemeral agent `Job`s, created at runtime by the two job controllers                                                                                         | the model API key — and nothing else                             |

The custom resources in `patchy` — `Finding`, `Repository`, `Investigation`, `Remediation`, `FindingRollup`, plus the
`Integration`/`Forge` configuration kinds — **are** the state machine; etcd is the only state store. The CRDs render
first in the base (`base/crds/`, controller-gen output).

Each controller is a **single replica** with `strategy: Recreate`. The binaries do run leader election (a coordination
Lease per controller) as insurance against a botched rollout racing two replicas, but singleton-by-construction stays
the deployment model — do not scale these up.

Every controller talks to the Kubernetes API now, so every controller identity mounts its token and gets a verb-by-verb
`Role` in `patchy` (see `base/rbac.yaml`); the two job controllers additionally share a Role in `patchy-agents` (jobs,
pods, pods/log, secrets). The agent Job pods have **no RBAC at all** and run with `automountServiceAccountToken: false`
— a prompt-injected agent must not be able to read the very Secrets the isolation model depends on.

## Images

All six images are built and published by GoReleaser (`dockers_v2` in `.goreleaser.yaml`) as part of every release:
multi-arch (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`) manifests pushed to `ghcr.io/bitwise-media-group/patchy/<name>` and tagged
`vX.Y.Z` + `latest`. GoReleaser compiles the binaries once and hands them to `docker buildx`; the repo-root
`Dockerfile.*` only assemble the runtime layer (`COPY $TARGETPLATFORM/<binary>`), so they cannot be `docker build`
directly from the repo. To build images locally, run `make snapshot` (needs docker + buildx) — it produces per-arch
`ghcr.io/...:v<next>-snapshot-<sha>-<arch>` images without pushing, ready for `kind load docker-image`. Each release
also uploads `digests.txt` and attests every image digest in it; verify with
`gh attestation verify --owner bitwise-media-group oci://ghcr.io/bitwise-media-group/patchy/<name>:vX.Y.Z`.

One Dockerfile builds all five controllers on the same `distroless/static` base; the per-image `build_args` in
`.goreleaser.yaml` set `TARGET` to pick the binary. Every controller is pure Go with no subprocesses — source-controller
downloads repository archives over the GitHub API and remediation-controller pushes the agent's changeset through the
Git Data API (`internal/ghpush`), so no controller image carries a `git` binary. Everything runs as uid 65532 with a
read-only root filesystem; `/tmp` is an `emptyDir` in every pod, which is what keeps the Go runtime's temp-file users
working.

The agent image is `debian:trixie-slim` carrying the `claude` CLI as Anthropic's self-contained native binary
(downloaded at build time from the official release bucket, sha256-verified against its manifest, pinned by
`ARG CLAUDE_VERSION` — Dependabot/renovate should bump it; versions are in lockstep with the `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`
npm package), plus `git`, `curl`, and `/bin/sh` for the init container's artifact fetch, and the `agent-runner` binary
on `PATH` under exactly that name (`internal/jobs` runs `Command: ["agent-runner"]`).

## GitHub App

Register one App for the whole pipeline and install it on the repositories patchy watches.

**Repository permissions:**

| Permission           | Access       | Why                                                          |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Code scanning alerts | Read & write | read alert detail; dismiss false positives (DESIGN.md req 6) |
| Issues               | Read & write | the tracking projection — open, label, comment, close        |
| Contents             | Read & write | download the repository archive; push the remediation branch |
| Pull requests        | Read & write | open the PR the human reviews                                |
| Metadata             | Read         | mandatory                                                    |

**Webhook events to subscribe:** `code_scanning_alert`, `issues`, `issue_comment`, `pull_request`.

**Webhook URL — exactly one, pointed at the integration-controller:** `https://<your-host>/github/webhooks`. The
integration-controller is the single receiver: it validates each delivery against the webhook secrets of your configured
Integrations, ingests scanner events into Findings, and applies the human signals (issue close, `/approve`, PR merge).
No other controller serves a webhook. The base ships a ClusterIP Service and no Ingress: put your Ingress or Gateway in
front of `patchy-integration-controller:8080` in your own overlay.

GitHub never retries a failed delivery on its own; enable `spec.github.redelivery` on the Integration and the controller
sweeps the App's delivery log every reconcile interval, redelivering anything that missed (App credentials required —
the delivery log is invisible to a PAT). The status page's user menu adds a full replay on demand (`spec.replay`, RBAC
verb `replay`).

Pipeline progress is **not** webhook-driven — the gates ("accumulation closed", "older than an hour", "a free
remediation slot") are conditions no event can announce. The controllers' watch-driven reconcile loops carry the
pipeline; the webhook path is ingestion and human-in-the-loop signals.

## Secrets and custom resources

Two Secrets, neither in git. Use SOPS or external-secrets; `base/secrets.example.yaml` is a commented template, not a
resource.

```sh
kubectl -n patchy create secret generic patchy-github \
  --from-literal=appID=123456 \
  --from-file=privateKey=./patchy.private-key.pem \
  --from-literal=webhookSecret="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"

# NOTE the namespace: the model key belongs to the AGENTS, not the controllers.
kubectl -n patchy-agents create secret generic patchy-anthropic \
  --from-literal=api-key="$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
```

`patchy-anthropic` is the claude runner's credential; `internal/jobs` wires it into a claude Job's agent container from
it, and the controllers refuse to start if an enabled harness's credential is missing. Enable the codex runner and it
needs `patchy-openai` (an OpenAI key) the same way. A fake-harness run (dev) needs no model credential at all.

The pipeline is then switched on with two custom resources referencing that Secret — an `Integration` (webhook
validation, alert ingestion, issue projection) and a `Forge` (repository read for the artifact, write for the push +
PR). `base/crs.example.yaml` is the commented template; the dev overlay applies working placeholders
(`overlays/dev/crs-dev.yaml`). No Deployment mounts a GitHub credential: the controllers read the Secret through the
API, on demand, by name.

## Configuration

Everything is `PATCHY_*` environment in one ConfigMap (`base/configmap.yaml`), consumed with `envFrom`.
`internal/cli/options.go` maps each variable back onto a cobra flag — prefix `PATCHY`, dashes become underscores, so
`--claude-agent-image` is `PATCHY_CLAUDE_AGENT_IMAGE` — with precedence flag > env > default. The Deployments pass no
flags but `serve`, so the ConfigMap is the whole configuration surface. A key a binary does not bind is inert, which is
why one ConfigMap serves all five.

The per-harness `PATCHY_<HARNESS>_AGENT_IMAGE` keys are a special case: they are the strings the job controllers stamp
into the Jobs they create, and kustomize's `images:` transformer **does not rewrite ConfigMap values**. An overlay that
pins a runner image must patch both the `images:` entry and the matching `PATCHY_<HARNESS>_AGENT_IMAGE` key.

## The isolation model — what it actually is

DESIGN.md requires the coding agent to run with "no internet access / no access to github APIs". Taken literally that is
unachievable: `claude -p` **is** a network client of `api.anthropic.com`. What is actually delivered:

**1. Credential absence — the real control.** The agent pod holds **no forge credential at all**, in any container. The
repository arrives as a tarball from source-controller's in-cluster artifact server: the URL carries an unguessable
128-bit id, the Job pins the sha256 digest, and the init container verifies it before extracting and synthesizing the
local git base. The per-Job Secret carries only handoff markdown; `internal/jobs` lists `GITHUB_TOKEN` in `reservedEnv`
so no configuration can smuggle a credential in. All GitHub side effects — issue projection, alert dismissal, branch
push, PRs — are performed controller-side with short-lived, per-repository scoped tokens. An agent that reaches
`github.com` reaches it as an anonymous member of the public.

**2. NetworkPolicy — the floor.** `patchy-agents` is default-deny in both directions. Egress is re-permitted for DNS,
the artifact port (9790) to source-controller only, and TCP 443 with the cluster's own ranges and the cloud metadata
endpoint (169.254.169.254) excluded. **A plain NetworkPolicy is L3/L4 and cannot match a hostname**, so "TCP 443" means
every HTTPS host on the internet, not just Anthropic's. Adjust the `except:` CIDRs in `base/networkpolicy.yaml` to your
cluster's pod/service/node CIDRs.

**3. Hostname policy — defence in depth, where the infrastructure supports it.** Add exactly one component; each narrows
that egress to `api.anthropic.com` and nothing else external. No GitHub hosts appear in the agent's allowlist at all,
because the pod never talks to a forge. Do not mistake the FQDN policy for the boundary; the missing credential is the
boundary.

- `components/cilium` (enabled by the prod overlay) — a `CiliumNetworkPolicy` with `toFQDNs`, plus a DNS rule bounding
  what names the pod may resolve at all. Requires Cilium with the DNS proxy.
- `components/gke-fqdn` — an `FQDNNetworkPolicy` (`networking.gke.io/v1alpha1`) for GKE Dataplane V2, which is Cilium
  underneath but has not honoured the `CiliumNetworkPolicy` CRD since 1.21.5-gke.1300 and rejects every L7 rule; the
  cilium component is inert there. Requires the cluster to carry `--enable-fqdn-network-policy`. It cannot express DNS
  or a ClusterIP destination, so both stay with the base policy — and DNS exfiltration stays open.
- `components/istio` — a `Sidecar` with `REGISTRY_ONLY` (exposing only the `api.anthropic.com` ServiceEntry and the
  `patchy` namespace's artifact Service), matched by SNI. Requires native sidecars (Kubernetes ≥ 1.29, istiod with
  `ENABLE_NATIVE_SIDECARS=true` — a classic sidecar hangs the Job) and the Istio CNI node agent (`patchy-agents`
  enforces the `restricted` Pod Security Standard, which rejects `istio-init`). Two differences from Cilium: the proxy
  does not constrain what names the pod may resolve, so DNS exfiltration stays open; and enforcement lives inside the
  pod rather than on the node.

The cilium and gke-fqdn components also patch the base policy — deleting `patchy-agents-egress` and removing its broad
443 rule respectively. That is load-bearing, not tidiness: network policies are **additive**, so an FQDN allowlist
sitting next to a rule that already permits 443 to `0.0.0.0/0` constrains nothing at all. The namespace default-deny
survives either patch, so a missing CRD fails the sandbox closed.

If you have none of the three, drop the components. The base policy still applies and is then the whole of the L3/L4
story.

## Applying

```sh
# Render and review first — both overlays must render clean.
kubectl kustomize deploy/kustomize/overlays/dev
kubectl kustomize deploy/kustomize/overlays/prod

kubectl apply -k deploy/kustomize/overlays/dev
```

The runbook order for a fresh cluster: apply the overlay (CRDs render first), create the two Secrets, apply your
`Integration`/`Forge` resources, then point the GitHub App's webhook at the integration-controller. Watch the pipeline
with `kubectl get patchy -n patchy` (the shared kubectl category) or `kubectl get findings -w`.

### dev (kind)

Local `patchy/*:dev` images (`make snapshot`, retag, then `kind load docker-image`), a NodePort webhook (30079 — point
your tunnel, `gh webhook forward` or smee.io, at it; map it with `extraPortMappings` in your kind config), minutes
instead of hours (2m accumulation, 2m minimum age, 30m finding TTL), the static-file fake CMDB enhancer mounted from a
ConfigMap, placeholder Integration/Forge CRs, and tiny resource requests. On
[Colima](https://oss.bitwisemedia.uk/patchy/deployment/colima/) the whole snapshot → retag → apply flow is one command,
`make dev-colima`, and no image loading is needed.

Three things to know about dev:

- **The placeholder GitHub credential fails every GitHub call** — ingestion and the CR state machine work (replay
  fixtures with `mise run replay`), but issue projection and repository artifacts error until a real credential arrives.
  The dev shortcut is a PAT: `GITHUB_TOKEN=<pat> make dev-colima` writes it into the `patchy-github` Secret (see
  `overlays/dev/secret-dev.yaml` for the by-hand equivalent).
- **kind runs kindnet, which ignores NetworkPolicy.** The policies apply cleanly and do nothing. A green dev apply is
  not evidence of a working sandbox.
- **The fake harness needs no model credential.** The dev overlay sets `PATCHY_HARNESSES: fake`, which restricts the
  enabled set to the fake runner — it carries no Secret, so `internal/jobs` wires no model key into its Jobs and dev
  runs with zero real credentials. The claude/codex runners configured in the base are simply not enabled.

### prod

DESIGN.md's real intervals (1h accumulation, 1h minimum age, the 14-day finding TTL), the claude harness (add codex by
enabling its runner and supplying `patchy-openai`), the Cilium FQDN policies, production-sized requests/limits, and
**digest-pinned images**. The `sha256:0000…` values in `overlays/prod/kustomization.yaml` and
`PATCHY_CLAUDE_AGENT_IMAGE` in `overlays/prod/configmap-patch.yaml` are placeholders — replace them with the digests
your release pipeline published before applying anything. Bring your real Secrets and `Integration`/`Forge` resources
with SOPS or external-secrets.

Ingress/TLS for the webhook endpoint is deliberately absent: add it in an environment overlay, in front of
`patchy-integration-controller:8080`.
