// Package auth resolves who is making a status-server request. It owns the
// sign-in surface — the OIDC authorization-code flow (the server itself is
// the OAuth2 client), the encrypted chunked session cookies, and the small
// SPA-visible state cookies — and hands the rest of the server a bare
// Identity. The package deliberately imports nothing from Kubernetes: what
// an identity may do is internal/web/authz's concern.
//
// Four modes exist, selected by the mounted configuration file:
// "unconfigured" (no file: no session is ever resolved and no sign-in routes
// are registered, leaving only the public surface), "none" (a fixed identity
// with authorization bypassed — development), "anonymous" (a fixed identity
// that still passes through RBAC access reviews), and "oidc" (the real
// SSO flow).
