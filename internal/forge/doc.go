// Package forge resolves a finding's repository URL to the Forge custom
// resource whose credentials may act on it, and mints per-operation scoped
// tokens from that Forge's secret.
//
// It is the single shared seam for forge access: source-controller resolves
// read scope (clone/tarball), remediation-controller resolves write scope
// (branch push, pull request). Matching is host equality, then the org
// allowlist, then the repository regexes; when several Forges match, the more
// constrained spec wins (orgs set beats unset, then repositories set beats
// unset) and a remaining tie is ErrAmbiguous — an operator configuration
// error, never silently resolved.
