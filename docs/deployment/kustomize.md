# Kustomize

The Helm chart is the primary deployment surface, but the same stack — identical resources, defaults, and isolation
model — renders from the kustomize tree in `deploy/`. Use it when your platform standardises on kustomize or you want
overlay-style patching; `deploy/README.md` in the repository is the full operator document.

Apply an overlay (render first with `kubectl kustomize` if you want to review):

```sh
kubectl apply -k deploy/kustomize/overlays/dev
kubectl apply -k deploy/kustomize/overlays/prod
```

The runbook order for a fresh cluster: apply the overlay (CRDs render first), create the
[two Secrets](../getting-started/install.md#create-the-secrets), apply your `Integration`/`Forge` resources
(`base/crs.example.yaml` is the commented walkthrough; the dev overlay ships working placeholders), then point the
GitHub App's webhook at the integration-controller.

## Configuration

Everything is `PATCHY_*` environment in one ConfigMap (`base/configmap.yaml`), consumed with `envFrom`. A key a binary
does not bind is inert, which is why one ConfigMap serves all five controllers — the
[configuration reference](../configuration/index.md) maps every key to its flag.

!!! warning "The agent image is pinned in two places"

    The per-harness `PATCHY_<HARNESS>_AGENT_IMAGE` keys are the strings the job controllers stamp into the Jobs they
    create, and kustomize's `images:` transformer does **not** rewrite ConfigMap values. An overlay that pins a runner
    image must patch both the `images:` entry and the matching key — the prod overlay does exactly that.

## The overlays

- **dev** targets a local kind or [Colima](colima.md) cluster: local `patchy/*:dev` images (`make snapshot`, retag,
  `kind load docker-image` — Colima skips the load), a NodePort webhook on 30079 (point your tunnel or `mise run replay`
  at `/github/webhooks`; kind needs `extraPortMappings`), a host-less dev Ingress for the same path, minutes instead of
  hours (2m accumulation and min-age, 30m finding TTL), the static-file fake CMDB enhancer mounted from a ConfigMap, the
  `fake` harness so no tokens are spent, placeholder `Integration`/`Forge` CRs, and tiny resource requests. Two caveats:
  the placeholder GitHub credential fails every GitHub call until you overwrite the `patchy-github` Secret with a PAT
  (`GITHUB_TOKEN=<pat> make dev-colima` does it for you), and kind's kindnet ignores NetworkPolicy — a green dev apply
  is not evidence of a working sandbox.
- **dev-fake** layers on dev for a fully credential-less end to end: the e2e suite's fake GitHub runs in-cluster
  (`patchy-fakegithub`, with a NodePort on 30990 for host-side inspection), the `Integration`/`Forge` CRs point at its
  Service, the agent image is a scripted stand-in (`hack/fake-agent`) that needs no model key, and one extra egress rule
  reaches the fake. The whole CR pipeline — ingestion through pull request, rollups, and the TTL — runs against it; the
  [Colima walkthrough](colima.md#credential-less-end-to-end-the-dev-fake-overlay) shows the full loop.
- **prod** uses the real intervals (1h accumulation and min-age, the 14-day TTL), the `claude` harness, the Cilium FQDN
  component, production-sized requests, and **digest-pinned images** — the checked-in `sha256:0000…` values are
  placeholders to replace with your release's published digests, including the `PATCHY_CLAUDE_AGENT_IMAGE` value in the
  ConfigMap patch. Bring real Secrets and CRs with SOPS or external-secrets, and put your Ingress or Gateway in front of
  `patchy-integration-controller:8080` in your own overlay — the base deliberately ships none.

The base's `secrets.example.yaml` and `crs.example.yaml` are documentation, not resources — the dev overlay's throwaway
values exist so the pods schedule and the CR state machine runs, not so GitHub calls succeed.
