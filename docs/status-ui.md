# The status page

Patchy's human surface beyond the tracking issues: a web dashboard served by the
[status-server](configuration/status-server.md) showing every `Finding` in the namespace, the two human gates
(`AwaitingApproval` holds and `HandedOff` revival), and the all-time `FindingRollup` statistics. The page is a single
embedded artifact — one self-contained HTML file compiled into the binary — with live updates: the server watches the
Finding and FindingRollup resources and nudges open browsers over Server-Sent Events to refetch.

## Views

The screenshots below show the [canned dev data](#canned-data-in-dev) — every finding deliberately suspended, hence the
`suspended` pill on each row.

- **Findings** — stat tiles, the eleven-phase lifecycle rail with live counts (click a phase to filter),
  severity/verdict/repository/text filters, and the board: severity, phase (with a live-dot while an agent run is active
  and a `suspended` pill), confidence, verdict, and age per finding.

- **Finding detail** — the advisory header with status and severity, tabs (Overview · Alerts · Timeline · Remediation),
  the metadata sidebar (owners, repository, source, tracking issue, advisories, dates), and the action bar. A completed
  remediation shows the merged PR; terminal states surface failure reasons, dismissal verdicts, and hand-off routes.

- **Rollups** — all-time statistics by total, repository, harness, and model scope: terminal-phase and verdict mixes,
  per-stage token/cost/duration aggregates, and the monthly trend. **This view is public** — it renders without signing
  in.

## Actions and what they really do

The action bar renders only the verbs the signed-in user is granted _and_ the finding's state machine allows:

| Action       | Available when                    | What the server writes                                          |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Approve**  | `AwaitingApproval` or `HandedOff` | `spec.approval` — the same record the `/approve` comment writes |
| **Retry**    | `Failed`                          | `spec.retry` — a recovery request                               |
| **Expedite** | any phase up to `Queued`          | `spec.expedite` — a standing urgency mark                       |
| **Suspend**  | any non-terminal phase            | `spec.suspend: true`                                            |
| **Resume**   | a suspended finding               | `spec.suspend: false`                                           |

The status server never moves a phase. Approving records the approval; the remediation-controller's spawner then drives
`AwaitingApproval → Queued` (or revives `HandedOff → Queued` when the approval is newer than the finding's completion)
exactly as it does for a `/approve` issue comment — the state machine's one-writer-per-edge rule holds no matter which
surface the human used.

**Retry** recovers a `Failed` finding to the state immediately before the failure: a failed investigation reverts to
`Enhanced` (the gate opens the next attempt), a failed remediation — or a pull request closed without merging — re-
queues to `Queued` (the spawner creates the next attempt). Each edge keeps its single writer: the investigation gate
drives `Failed → Enhanced`, the remediation spawner `Failed → Queued`. A retry is consumed by the recovery itself; if
the finding fails again, another retry is required.

**Expedite** marks the finding urgent for its whole lifetime: the investigation gate skips the accumulation window and
minimum-age wait, and both schedulers rank the finding's runs ahead of all non-expedited work. It does not bypass an
`AwaitingApproval` hold — that remains approve's job.

## Access model

Two tiers, on purpose:

1. **Rollups are public.** Aggregate statistics carry no finding content; they serve without authentication so the page
   is useful as a wallboard even with no auth configured.
2. **Findings require sign-in + RBAC.** Without an [auth configuration](configuration/status-server.md), the findings
   views show "sign-in is not configured" and nothing else leaves the cluster. With one, a signed-in user sees findings
   only if RBAC grants `get` on `findings`, and each action button only with the matching custom verb (`approve` /
   `retry` / `expedite` / `suspend` / `resume` on `findings.patchy.bitwisemedia.uk`):

```yaml
rules:
  - apiGroups: [patchy.bitwisemedia.uk]
    resources: [findings, findingrollups]
    verbs: [get, list]
  - apiGroups: [patchy.bitwisemedia.uk]
    resources: [findings]
    verbs: [approve] # this user gets the Approve button, nothing else
```

Bind roles like this to the values of the OIDC `username`/`groups` claims (RoleBindings in the patchy namespace; grants
apply uniformly across its findings). Ready-made viewer / approver / operator tiers ship in
`deploy/kustomize/base/rbac.users.example.yaml`, and the helm chart renders them with
`statusServer.rbac.userRoles=true`.

## Exposing the page

The Service is `patchy-status-server:8080`. Front it with your Ingress or Gateway on its **own hostname** — keeping it
apart from the webhook endpoint separates human authn from HMAC-signed machine traffic (helm: `statusServer.host` +
`statusServer.ingress` / `statusServer.httpRoute`). For a quick look without any exposure:

```sh
kubectl -n patchy port-forward svc/patchy-status-server 8080:8080
# → http://localhost:8080  (with the dev overlay's `mode: none` auth: full access)
```

## Canned data in dev

The dev overlay ships representative canned data so the page is worth looking at without running the pipeline:
`deploy/kustomize/overlays/dev/findings-demo.yaml` carries one `Finding` per lifecycle phase (the screenshots above)
plus `FindingRollup` statistics for every scope. `kubectl apply -k` creates the objects but cannot write their status
subresource, so seed the phases and rollup buckets with:

```sh
mise run status-demo
```

The data is deliberately inert — every finding is **suspended** (the enhancer, gate, and spawner all skip suspended
findings), none carries a `trackingRef` (so nothing is projected to GitHub), and terminal phases carry no `completedAt`
(so the rollup/TTL loop neither aggregates nor reaps them). Actions still work against it: resume one of the canned
findings and the controllers will pick it up for real, which is a fine way to watch the pipeline run.
